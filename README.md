# Overview of the Analysis
In this project, analysis of ride-sharing data was conducted to find trends relating to the number of drivers and riders utilizing the PyBer ride-sharing app in rural, suburban, and urban cities.  These trends will help PyBer improve the usability of the ride-sharing service in areas that are found to be under-served.  Additionally, average fares were analyzed for each ride in the three types of cities in order to help with the affordability of the service.

# Results
To analyze the data, first a dataframe was created from the city data and ride data CSV files to summarize the ride, driver, and fare data for each type of city.  Secondly, a line chart was plotted showing fare data by each type of city over a period of time from 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019.  These are each pictured below in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively.  As seen in these figures, the most rides and drivers can be found in Urban areas, as well as the highest fare totals.  Rural areas, conversely, have the least amount of drivers and riders, and therefore the lowest fare totals.  Notably, rural and suburban areas appear to have more riders than drivers, while urban areas have somewhat significantly more drivers available than rides taken.  Also, all three city types have roughly their greatest amount of fares in late February, and roughly their least amount of fares in early January.

# Summary
The results of this analysis provide a few different avenues to potentially improve the accessibility and affordability of PyBerâ€™s ride-sharing service.  First, the disparity between drivers and riders rural and suburban cities implies that more drivers being available would be beneficial to providing more rides in these areas.  In addition to this, the fares per ride and driver are greater in these areas, so more drivers may reduce the price and allow rides to be more cost-effective to consumers in these cities.  Secondly, in contrast to rural and suburban cities, the greater number of drivers compared to riders in urban areas implies that fewer drivers are necessary to serve these areas.  Finally, driver amounts could potentially be increased or decreased over time to account for the fare disparities seen in Figure 2, where, for example, fares are lower in early January but higher in late February.
